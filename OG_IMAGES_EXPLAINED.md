# Understanding OG Images

## ⚠️ Important: OG Images Are NOT Visible on Your Website

**OG (Open Graph) images are NOT displayed on your actual website pages.** They are **only** used when your pages are shared on social media platforms.

## 🎯 Where OG Images Appear

OG images appear in:

1. **Facebook** - When someone shares your link
2. **Twitter/X** - When someone tweets your link
3. **LinkedIn** - When someone shares your link
4. **WhatsApp** - When someone shares your link
5. **Slack/Discord** - When someone shares your link
6. **Other social platforms** - Link previews

**They do NOT appear:**
- ❌ On your actual website pages
- ❌ In your browser when visiting the site
- ❌ In search results (Google uses different images)

## 🔍 Why You Might Not See Images Yet

### 1. **Social Media Cache**
Social platforms cache OG images for 24-48 hours. Even if you update your images, they might show the old cached version.

**Solution:** Use the "Scrape Again" or "Clear Cache" button in the validators above.

### 2. **Images Not Yet Deployed**
If you just pushed changes, wait 2-5 minutes for Netlify to deploy.

**Check:** Visit `https://artificial.one/images/og-homepage.jpg` directly in your browser.

### 3. **Testing in Wrong Place**
If you're looking for images on your actual website pages, you won't find them there. OG images are meta tags, not visible content.

## 💡 Pro Tip

To see how your pages look when shared:

2. Paste it in a new Facebook post (don't publish)
3. You'll see the preview with your OG image
4. Same works for Twitter, LinkedIn, etc.

## ❓ Still Not Working?

If images still don't appear in social previews after:
1. ✅ Images are accessible directly (you confirmed this)
2. ✅ OG tags are in page source (you confirmed this)
3. ✅ Using "Scrape Again" in Facebook Debugger

Then check:
- **Netlify deployment:** Ensure images folder is deployed (check Netlify dashboard)
- **Image permissions:** Ensure images are publicly accessible
- **URL format:** Ensure URLs use `https://` not `http://`

**Remember: OG images are for social sharing, not for your website display!**
